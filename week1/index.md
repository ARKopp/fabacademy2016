##Git Tutorial

I only got into git a couple of weeks earlier and can recommend [this tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). 




`git init`  
`git clone username@host:/path/to/repository`  
`git add <filename>`  
`git commit -m "Commit message"`  
`git push origin master`  
`git pull`

Also I am recommending [Macdown ](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)a open source Markdown editor for Mac. 


## My Website :




```bash
# im fabacademy order:
	generate-md --layout github --input ./ --output ../fablabbcn2016/students/375/
```

### Preview of Website:

Damit ich unter [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) starte ich einen python server in 

```bash
cd ../fablabbcn2016/students/375/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```


#Final Project

My idea is to build a post-it stick machine
