I love pixel art and make pixel art [myself](postitman.de). I was always sticking post-its or origami manually but would love to have a machine helper. So for my final project I want to make a post-it plotter that can stick post-its to any surface. I call it the stickomat and start my own invasion.

Similar to this [Coffee plotter](http://makezine.com/2016/02/24/this-machine-prints-portraits-8000-drops-coffee/) that prints with droplets of coffee only vertical.

## Week 10 

In week 10 I finally thought more about my final project and I realized I still need a couple of things.

* learn sketchup to simulate my machine
* learn Rhino to simulate my machine
* make a small scale model
* Develop the feeder: similar mechanism like pick and place, buy venturi valves
* Chose a machine design: [Openbuild?](http://openbuilds.org/), Drawbot
* Find a way to stick it to glass but also other surfaces: Drones???
* Develop the brain/software
