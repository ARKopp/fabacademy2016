*Weeks Assignment*

* Try out as many Electronic Design Tools as possible
* redraw the echo hello-world board,
* add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor)
* check the design rules, and make it
* extra credit: simulate its operation
* extra credit: measure its operation

## Fritzing

I first wanted to download the fritzing realising that I already have downloaded it previously. 

You can design your PCB with the software and [order](http://fab.fritzing.org/fritzing-fab) your PCB as well from them. 

There is also a guide 

## Eagle

Then I [downloaded](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) Eagle. There is a [freeware version](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/freeware/) with some limitations.

## Virtial Breadboard

## Kicad

I also downloaded Kicad for Max.

## Fusion 360 and CadSoft EAGLE

## Makin the Board

## Project Files

[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3iYmii-HJ7TLWdPZUMwb3B6QjA) all project files from this assigment from my Google Drive.

## Learnings

This week I finally connected the Google Drive Mac Version that helped me to link the download links of my project files.
