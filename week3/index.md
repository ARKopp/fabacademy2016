# Week 3 - COMPUTER-CONTROLLED-CUTTING

Februar 10 - Februar 17

[Lecture site ](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/index.html)

~~~
*Weeks Assigment*

Learning outcomes:

Demonstrate and describe 2D modelling processes 
Identify and explain processes involved in using the this machine. 
Develop, evaluate and construct the final prototype

Have you:

Explained how you drew your files
Shown how you made your press-fit kit
Eaten fresh vegetables today
Included your design files and photos of your finished project

Vinyl Cutting

There is no specific project that is focussed on this very useful tool. There are a range of ways you might utilise it throughout the programme, or your local instructor may set a specific project. You 

might make:
stickers
flexible circuit boards
a textured surface/relief pattern 
screenprint resists/stencils
Ensure that you have used it in some way during this time and met the objectives below.

Learning outcomes:

Identify and explain processes involved in using this machine. 
Design and create the final object

Have you:

Explained how you drew your files
Shown how you made your vinyl project
Included your design files and photos of your finished project

## Lecture Notes
 


Parametic design
gimp
clone
use the software of your machine and fabmodules

### vinyl cutter

not cut with to much and to less force

use the vinyl cutter this week 


### Laser Cutter

Screenprint

Holes

Fabmodulde --> not vector but have tone


#### Make a Construction Kit

Champber - take a missalignment and alines it  + compresses the material  -> better joint


Fairly small window to get the joint 


1. Just make the joint
2. Parametric tools to make parametric design
3. Use Inkscape, solidworks, fusion350, antimony



beam diamter speciefied in fab modules


laser has to be attend -> it can get on fire

it has to have good exhaust

good card board bow 

structural cardboard
heavy shipping cardboard

power and speed setting 

tables of setting of materials you use


just make any thing on the vinyl and make a parametric construction kit. A set of parts
