*Weeks Assignment*

Make Something Big


~~~


I planned to use the Shopbot in the Makerspace in Munich but the machine was not working in the week I needed it to use so I used the week to research where there are other large wood CNC machines and CNC service providers around Munich and prepare my cutting files. 

I found a course in the [MakerSpace Shop Bot Course ](http://www.maker-space.de/course/37.cnc-002-cnc-holzfraese-shopbot-und-einfuehrung-in-die-software-vcarve-fuer-einsteiger-sgk-c.html) on the 6.4. and that there are workshops as well in the Fablab Zurich.

There is also a [CNC course in the fablab Berlin](https://fablab.berlin/en/workshops/24-cnc-milling-introduction.html) with a BZE PFE 1000 PX for 240 € but the next course will be in the middle of April and when I was in the Fablab Berlin in the week after easter I could not find the time to do a personal introduction.

After looking for alternatives I finally found CNC shop that will let me use the CNC at the end of the week. This was also a great exercises to find out who has a big CNC machine around Munich and who I could work with in the future. I think there is the need of something like [Chop Shop](http://chopshopcnc.com/) that offers CNC and Lasercutting Services for Artists, Designers and Start-ups and Makers that do not have this big machines.

I also looked at platforms like [100k Garage](http://www.100kgarages.com/) in the US and [Fabhub](https://www.fabhub.io/) that list CNC Shops. Laser Cutters and 3D Printers and other Workshops. Unfortunately there are not many listing in Germany yet.

I also found [Make Works](http://makeworks.co.uk/scotland/process/cnc-machining) a directory of local fabricators, material suppliers and workshop facilities a the moment in Scotland and Birmingham. I would love to have something like that here in Bavaria.

To get an idea about prices I asked for a quote of a desk and a stool from [open desk](https://www.opendesk.cc/) that transferred me to a local CNC Shop east of Munich. The estimate was 540 € for two chairs.

***Update 27. April***

I never got a real quote from them. They told me that they did not get a quote from th CNC Shop.

I looked at some other students like [Till ](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/cremer.till/08.html) and [Helga](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/hauksdottir.sigridur_helga/W8_computer_controlled_machining.html) and [Paul](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabamsterdam/students/90/week7.html) from Amsterdam and also looked at [this site](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/gunnarsson.thorarinn_b.b/week.8.html) after I heard it in the review. 

Finally I remembered that I have a Booth Builder in my network that has a CNC and I asked if I could do it at his shop.  

## What I'm gonna for this assignment?

For this assignment I wanted to make a [Maker Bench](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/collection.html?id=ub750b5d7-37d7-4479-b8e6-f4532018adb5) and design design some adaption to fit my Ult2go and the Other mill on top of it.

For that I need to download the Sketch Up Pro Version and then make my adaptions and export a dxf model. 


### Design and Prototype

*Update 11. April:*

Software: SketchUp Pro, Solidworks
Tools: Lasercutter

Finally during my week in Barcelona I managed to set up Sketchup Pro and got the dxf file of the Maker Bench out of Sketchup. I decided to first make a model of the table and cut it with the Lasercutter. 

Because the table is too big to take home to Munich I decided to make a stool for a standing table. 


*Update 21. April:*

I looked at all the chairs and stools I could find in the fablab and finally decided to make a cnc design of the first stool I build at Fablab Munich.

I also had a look at [this](http://www.instructables.com/id/50-Digital-Joints-poster-visual-reference/) poster with 50 digital joints.
