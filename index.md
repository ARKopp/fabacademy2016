# About

Hi, I am Andreas a 32 year old guy from Munich Germany who makes a living tinkering and teaching kids coding and eletronics. Also I am building up my own fablab and raspberry pi academy at the moment focused on small and big kids called [erfindergarden](http://www.erfindergarden.de) and plan a fablab world tour after the academy program with my [Mincraft Hacking workshop](https://raspi-grundlagen-wien.eventbrite.de).


## My Story

I studied business and engineering and first started working in software sales. But I realized that beeing an employee is nothing for me so started working for myself in 2011.

My creazy journey started when I filmened and help creating a post-it art work of Steve Jobs at the Apple store after his death. This youtube video went viral and since then I have been creating [post-it art portraits](http://www.postitartreators.com) and pictures for conferences, commercials and art shows. 

In 2013 I build the [pixomat](http://www.pixomat.co) a pixel photobooth in a shopwindow on the other site of the street of the Steve Jobs portrait and since then got deeper and deeper into the maker world learning coding, electronics, raspberry pi, 3D Printing, Laser Cutting and since 2014 started teaching that knowledge to kids and also started freelancing for [hybris/SAP labs](http://labs.hybris.com) as a creative technologist.


## So why do I do the fabacademy ?

By doing the fabacademy I want to gain deeper knowledge in the fablab technoligies and get to know other and share knowledge with other makers and other fablabs that I can visit on my fablab tour. I also think it is a good way to focus my energy on a project I have been dreaming to build for a while - [the stickomat](final).
