# Week 16 Applications and Interface (WIP)

Mai 18 - Mai 25

~~~
*Weeks Assignment*

write an application that interfaces with an input &/or output device that you made

~~~

For this week my goal is to make a space invader game and control it with my input hall sensor. I also want to try out a couple of different programming languages and frameworks I have not tried yet like Scratch for Arduino.

## Arduino-Scratch Space Invader Game


### Hello World

First I wanted to show you how you would program hello world in Scratch

First I wanted to make a space invader game and use my Otherduino and control it with a button and then redo a button invader. 

First I just looked for any game and added two buttons.  


# Arduino + Minecraft 


# Serial + Processing

We had a review by Ferdi where he eplained how  we could 

# Serial + Arduino

# Serial + Openframeworks

Also I wante to try out t read a serial and write an Openframe Works Application. Luckily there already exists a serial communication example. I just need to change the tty of my FTDI Kabel to read the serial data of my input invader. 

I wanted to also programme a tachneedle like in tkinter and a friend helped mt to do it.
