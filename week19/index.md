# Week 18 - Project Development



~~~
*Weeks Assigment*


   document a final project that integrates the range of units covered, answering:
         what does it do?
         who's done what beforehand?
         what did you design?
         what materials and components were used?
         where did they come from?
         how much did they cost?
         what parts and systems were made?
         what processes were used?
         what questions were answered?
         how was it evaluated?
         what are the implications?
      projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery of all of the skills
      where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project
   present your final project, weekly assignments, and tutorials
