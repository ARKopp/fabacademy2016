*Weeks Assignment*

* what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? 
* what has worked? what hasn't?
* what questions need to be resolved?
* what will happen when?
* what have you learned?
   documentation during development
   demand- vs supply-side time management
   spiral development

I answer these questions on my [final projects]((../final)) site. 


In this weeks lecture Neils talks about that rapid protoyping with ealge and milling is faster then breadboarding. I am stilling trying to get faster in milling and designing. It still takes me a day. Most of the time I spend in eagle and then debugging the board.

--> demand side vs supply side time management
--> spiral development

Project management makes the difference between people that makes stuff work and people that not
