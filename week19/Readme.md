# Week 19 - Project Development

[Lecture](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html), [Video](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/master/videos/06-08/index.html)

~~~
*Weeks Assignment*

complete your final project, tracking your progress:

* what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? 
* what has worked? what hasn't?
* what questions need to be resolved?
* what will happen when?
* what have you learned?
   documentation during development
   demand- vs supply-side time management
   spiral development

~~~


I answer these questions on my [final projects]((../final)) site. 


In this weeks lecture Neils talked about that rapid protoyping with eagle and milling is faster then breadboarding. But it still takes me a day to finish a design and to mill a board and to solder it and program it. Most of the time I spend in eagle and then debugging the board.

## What tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? 

***Update 28 June 2016:***

I really want to improve my space invader but I believe I wont have time before leaving Barcelona to complete all the tasks I wanted to do. But I want to continue design a smaller board and let it produce in China and do my workshop with it in China. 


* <del>Design and mill Hall Breakout v1</del>
* <del>Program Board v1<del>
* <del>Code for OLED Display in Arduino</del>
* <del>Add Condesator and Button v3</del>
* <del>Mill and solder board v3</del>
* <del>Design and mill Hall Breakout Double Sided</del>
* <del>Design Housing</del>
* <del>3D Print Housing</del>
* <del>make slide</del> 
* <del>make video</del> 
* Design Mold for Housing
* Mold Housing
* make a smaller board version
* send board to be made in China
* make a new Hall Sensor Break out board

* optional: Raspberry Pi Zero HAT
* optional: add Bluetooth and Radio
* optional: Make a Light blue bean hat



## What has worked? What hasn't?

### Worked

* I2C
* the Oled
* the Code
* the magnet on the wheel
* power on 5V


### Not worked

* the position of the hall sensor
* the housing
* power on 3V


## What questions need to be resolved?

I still need to make the board smaller and figure out if I can run it on 3V with a coin battery. Also I need to test it once I have mounted if it can stand a crash. 


## What will happen when?


6 - 12 June: 1st Arduino Prototype Programming Interrupts, Attiny Board Design, Milling, Soldering, Desgining Interface, Programming 


13 - 20 June: 3D Printing Case, Put everything together, Make Video

20 - 30 June: Design Small board for production in China, Mill Protoype


30 - 8 July: Finish Documenting 



## What have you learned?

I learned that I need do more complete protypes quickly that work. I had one working board finished and then I tried to improve on the battery but I should have made a housing right away and thought about how to position the sensor on the axle.
